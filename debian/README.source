Upstream includes some non-free components and must be repacked to be included
in Debian.

For 3.7.0 this involved:

* Delete device/non-free
* Delete support/sdbinutils/bfd/doc/*.texi*
* Modify support/sdbinutils/bfd/doc/Makefile.{am,in} to not reference texi files.
* chmod 644 device/lib/is{nan,inf}.c

    The bulk of the compiler is licensed under the GPL version 2 or later, while
    the assemblers originating from Alan R. Baldwin are licensed GPL version 3
    or later.  Various files associated with support for specific processors carry
    other licenses, all of which appear to be compatible with both versions 2 and 3
    of the GPL.  On Debian systems, the complete text of both GPL versions can be 
    found in the directory /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2.

    The sdcc library is licenced either as GPL, GPL+LE or LGPL.

    With GPL+LE the following special exception applies:
    As a special exception, if you link this library with other files,
    some of which are compiled with SDCC, to produce an executable,
    this library does not by itself cause the resulting executable to
    be covered by the GNU General Public License. This exception does
    not however invalidate any other reasons why the executable file
    might be covered by the GNU General Public License.

FSF changes to this file are in the public domain.

Calling this script install-sh is preferred over install.sh, to prevent
`make' implicit rules from creating a file called install from it
when there is no Makefile.

This script is compatible with the BSD install script, but was written
from scratch.
